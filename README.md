## Description ##

At some point I was wondering what the fuzz was about regarding the 30 fps vs.
60 fps debate in Gaming.  So I wrote a small C programme which shows an
animation and allows the user to change the frame-rate on the fly.  It allows
switching between 15, 24, 30, 60, 75, and 120 fps.  Just note that frame-rates
higher than the refresh rate of your monitor have no effect.


## Usage ##

The programme uses the following keybindings:

 * `+`: Increase frame-rate
 * `-`: Decrease frame-rate
 * `Q` or `ESC`: Quit programme


## License ##

The programme uses the MIT license which can be found in the accompanying
`LICENSE` file.

This excludes the Vera Sans font, the license of which can be found in
`fonts/vera/COPYRIGHT.TXT`.
